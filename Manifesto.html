        <h1>Manifesto</h1>
           
                <h2>In my art and design practice, I draw inspiration from my personal experiences and the surrounding environment. Each project becomes a canvas for exploration, where mediums converge and boundaries blur. Concepts transform into visually compelling and impactful designs, serving as a reminder of our collective belonging. </h2>
                <br>
                <h2>Through thoughtful design, we can create solutions that benefit both our communities and the planet, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive future. By addressing environmental challenges and promoting social equity, design becomes a powerful tool for positive change, encouraging collaboration and inspiring collective action.</h2>
