        <h1>Manifesto</h1>
           
                <h2>In my exploration of communication, I’m mostly silly but can sometimes be serious to remind us of our collective belonging. With an interest in the extreme sides of the spectrum and the tension in between, each project becomes a canvas for exploration. Mediums converge, boundaries blur and the client (if there is one) is satisfied. </h2>
                <br>
                <h2>Over the next few years, I aim to create thoughtful design solutions that benefit our communities and the planet, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive future. By addressing environmental challenges and promoting social equity, design becomes a powerful tool for positive change. So let’s collaborate, inspire and make the world a better place one step at a time.</h2>
