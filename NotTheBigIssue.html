    <h1>Not The Big Issue</h1>
    <h1>[Brand Refresh]</h1>
    <h1>The objective for the design refresh of The Big Issue is to create a brand that embodies inclusivity and celebrates the inherent self-worth of its vendors. At the same time, the aim is to cultivate a brand identity that resonates with the public, fostering empathy, understanding, and support for its mission. By infusing the brand with a new, modern design aesthetic, the goal is to not only enhance its visual appeal but also make it more accessible and engaging to a broader audience. This will elevate The Big Issue as not only a platform for social change but also as a beacon of hope within our communities.</h1>
